Project 2 - PDS (GOI grain ration) management application
--------------------------------------------------------

Android application for modernizing ration distribution system using QR code validation at the ration card holder level.
The ‘ration shop’ owner would be using this application to administer the rations to citizens.
The device Id of the ration shop owner would be verified by GOI PDS DB and access to the system would be given.


All current ration card holders would have to be verified and a new QR code page would be posted in their ration cards. The QR code in the ration card would have ration card #, name, age, address of the ration card holder.	
A citizen who wants to get the rations of the month would be signed in with the QR code.
The citizen would procure the rations, rations given would be deducted from the net stock.
